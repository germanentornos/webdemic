        <h1>HTML</h1>

        <h3>HTML 1.0</h3>
        <p>The basic version of HTML has support for basic elements like text controls and images. This was the very basic version of HTML with less support for a wide range of HTML elements. It does not have rich features like styling and other
          things that were related to how content will be rendered in a browser.</p>
        <p>The initial version of HTML does not provide support for tables, font support, etc., like it provides us in the latest version.</p>

        <h3>HTML 2</h3>
        <p>Now a standard got started to develop so as to maintain common rules and regulations across different browsers. HTML 2.0 has improved a lot in terms of the markup tags. In HTML 2.0 version concept of form came into force. Forms were
          developed but still, it was having basic tags like text boxes, buttons, etc.</p>
        <p>Also, the table came as an HTML tag. Now, in HTML tag 2.0 browsers also came with the concept of creating own layers of tags that were specific to the browser itself. W3C was also formed. The main intention of W3C is to maintain standard
          across different web browsers so that these browsers understand and render HTML tags in a similar manner.</p>

        <h3>HTML 3.2</h3>
        <p>With version 3.2 of HTML, HTML tags were further improved. It is worth noting that because of W3C standard maintenance, the newer version of HTML was 3.2 instead of 3.</p>
        <p>Now, HTML 3.2 has better support for new form elements. Another important feature that HTML 3.2 implemented was support for CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is CSS that provides features to make HTML tags look better on
          rendering it on browsers. CSS helps to style HTML elements.</p>
        <p>With upgradation of browsers to HTML 3.2, the browser also supported for frame tags although HTML specifications still do not support frame markup tags.</p>

        <h3>HTML 4.01</h3>
        <p>In version 3.2, CSS were embedded in HTML page itself. Therefore, if the website has various web pages to apply to the style of each page, we must place CSS on each web page. Hence there was a repetition of the same block of CSS.</p>
        <p>To overcome this thing, in version 4.01 the concept of external styling sheet emerged. Under this concept, an external CSS file could be developed and this external styling file could be included in HTML itself. HTML 4.01 provided
          support
          for further new tags of HTML.</p>
        <h3>HTML 5</h3>
        <p>This is the latest version of HTML. For a developer, it was available from 2014. It came up with lots of HTML tags support. HTML5 provided support for new form elements like input elements of different types, geolocations support tags,
          etc.</p>


        <h1>XHTML</h1>

        <h3>1.2. Major Differences with XHTML 1</h3>

        <p>XHTML 2 is designed to be recognizable to the HTML and XHTML 1 author, while correcting errors and insufficiencies identified in earlier versions of the HTML family, and taking the opportunity to make improvements.</p>

        <p>The most visible changes are the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>More structuring possibilities.</li>
          <li>Type: in HTML 4, the @srctype attribute when referring to an external resource was purely a hint to the user agent. In XHTML 2 it is no longer a hint, but specifies the type(s) of resource the user agent must accept.</li>
          <li>Tables: the content model of tables has been cleaned up and simplified, while still allowing the same functionality.</li>
          <li>Edit: rather than use explicit ins and del elements to mark changes in a document, an attribute @edit may be used on any element for the same purpose.</li>
          <li>Metadata: the meta and link elements have been generalized, and their relationship to RDF [RDF] described. Furthermore, the attributes on these two elements can be more generally applied across the language.</li>
          <li>Forms: XForms are an integral part of XHTML 2.</li>
        </ul>
